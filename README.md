# Summary

A dead-simple standard for language agnostic tests.

Jassertions are JSON objects that contain input and output values.

Jcases are JSON objects that contain an array of Jassertions. They can also optionally contain a description string and/or a context JSON value.

Jsuites are JSON objects that contain an array of Jcases. They can also optionally contain a description string.

# Version

Unreleased

# Todo

Write tests for Jsuites as well as Jcases.
